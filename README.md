# Articles-RESTfulAPI
This is a RESTful API created to manage articles. Each article database item has a title and content field. For the "/articles" route you can (GET, POST, DELETE) articles. For a specific article you can (GET,PUT,PATCH,DELETE) at "/articles/:userArticle".

To run this you can download the files and can use software such as POSTMAN to test out the API. To run the files on a server, you need to download the files and in the source directory run "npm i" and then "node app.js" to run the server on localhost:3000.
